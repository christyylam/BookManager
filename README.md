# My Book Manager Application

## Keep track of all the books you've read!

Some features:
- Organize books by the genre or author
- Lets users visualize their book collection
- Keeps track of user's ratings for each book
- Lets users enter reviews for each book

This application will help users keep track of the books that they
have read by visualizing their entire collection, keeping track of their reviews and ratings for each book,
and allowing users to organize books by the genre or author. This application is for anyone who enjoys reading. 

This project is of interest to me because I enjoy reading as a hobby. I want an
application to refer to where I can see the books that I have read and what I thought about them, since I usually 
start forgetting as time passes.
